# Mobile_Beginner_App_Xamarin.Forms
Beginner app made with Xamarin.Forms
First mobile app that was made as a Class Project.
Did not upload the Android because there are too many files.

The app was made with two clients in mind, the Merchandiser (who needed to organize products on the shelf of Retail Stores) and their Supervisors (who were to assign stores to the Merchandisers and add/remove and update the Retail stores).
Basic app with a few lists that are connected to SQLite local database with two seperate types of pages for the clients. Supervisor page allowed them to add/remove and update a list of retail stores and they can assign stores for the Merchandiser to do for the day and the Merchandiser can see these updates on their side of the app and can then add comments to that store to tell Supervisors about the job they just did.
